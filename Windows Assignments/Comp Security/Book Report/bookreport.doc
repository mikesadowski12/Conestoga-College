\ul\par
\ulnone 2) \tab\ul Ed Skoudis\ulnone  is the founder and senior security consultant for Intelguardians Network Intelligence, LLC. His specializes in hacker attacks and defenses, the information security industry, and computer privacy issues. He has performed various security assessments, designed information security rules and regulations, and has responded to computer attacks for clients in financial, high technology, health care, and other industries. Ed Skoudis is also the coauthor of Malware: Fighting Malicious Code. He was also awarded 2004 and 2005 Microsoft MVP awards for Windows Server Security, and is an alumnus of the Honeynet Project. \par
\tab I believe Ed Skoudis is qualified to write about this topic because he has been in the industry for years, even winning awards for his work. He has been working in the Computer Security industry for quite a while, so he must have a lot of experience in dealing with computer attacks, and knows what to look for, how the hackers could have done it, and how to prevent these attacks, which is why I believe he is qualified to write on this subject.\par
\par
\tab\ul Tom Liston\ulnone  is the senior analyst for Intelguardians Network Intelligence, LLC. He is the author of LaBrea, which he was a finalist for eWeek and PC Magazine's Innovations In Infrastructure (i3) award in 2002. He is one of the handlers at the SANS Institute's Internet Storm Center, where he deals with security issues and writes articles called "Follow the Bouncing Malware." \par
\tab Tom Liston is qualified to write on this subject because he, just like Ed Skoudis, has been in the industry for a long time as well. His job is to investigate computer attacks, and prevent them. He also write many articles on the Computer Security topic, so he must be keeping up to date with current technologies and recent attacks, making him an expert in Computer Security.\par
\par
3) The book is 784 pages.\par
\par
4)\tab  The authors' objective is to provide the reader with a detailed description of how computer attacks occur, how they are carried out, what to look for when investigating these attacks, and how to prevent the attacks from happening. They go into full detail about how different types of attacks are carried out (step by step), and how they can be prevented. The intended audience for this book would have to be Computer Security fanatics/extremists, and people who are extremely interested and devoted to learning about Computer Security. This is because the book goes into great detail about topics such as firewalls, networks, and many other tools and topics related to Computer Security, and only people who are very devoted to this industry will know/be interested in what the authors are talking about.\par
\par
5) The book is split up into 3 different sections. The first section is about different technologies used in many systems (Linux/UNIX, Windows, and Networking). The authors talk about how almost all machines and systems are using this technology, and how the attackers would be exploiting these system using the exact same tools on which they run on. \par
\tab The second section is a lot more interesting. Each chapter was broken up into 5 different phases of attacks: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access at the Operating System and Application Level, Gaining access at the Network Level, Gaining Access and Denial of Service Attacks, Maintaining Access, and Covering Tracks. \par
\tab In the Reconnaissance chapter, the authors' talk about how hackers go about choosing their "target", and the different techniques and tools they use to do so. They talk about Caller ID spoofing, and give some tips and tricks on how to use it. They also talk about the most popular technique hackers use to find vulnerabilities in a system, and that it is none other than Google. \par
\tab In the Scanning chapter, they describe several techniques that hackers use to find and exploit vulnerable LANs. They discuss port scans, version scanning, and a tool called Nmap. The last part of this chapter they discuss how you can find the active ports of your system, and how to shut down unneeded services such as _______.\tab\par
\tab In the  Operating System and Application Level chapter, the authors discuss different types of buffer overflows, the two main ones being stack-based and heap-based. They also introduce tools likeMetasploit, mainly the framework tool used for creating  exploitation code against a target, and Cain and Abel, and how it is used to crack passwords. At the end of this chapter, they go into detail about Web Applications, Web Goat, and how exploiting Web browsers is becoming very popular amongst attackers.\par
\tab The Gaining access at the Network Level chapter talks about operating system fingerprinting, port stealing, and session hijacking (using a tool called Ettercap). In the last part of this chapter, a tool called Netcat is introduced, and demonstrated how it can be used to create a "persistent listener", and how to create a honeypot to detect and deflect attacks.\par
\tab In the Gaining Access and Denial of Service Attacks chapter talks about TCP Reset Attacks, and the bot threat in DDoS floods. The "pulsing zombie" attack is also introduced, and how it isn't a traditional DoS attack, but rather ties up just enoough resources that network adminstrators will not notice, and how difficult it is to detect one.\par
\tab The Maintaining Access chapter goes into detail about rootkits, bots, spyware, and virtual machines.\par
\tab In the Covering Tracks chapter, the authors talk about Alternate Data Streams, and Covert Channels, and different tools that are used to do these (such as Nushu). They also talk about the increase in Covert Channels by malware and spyware. The last part of this chapter is how attackers embed their data inside of normal traffic using Nushu.\par
\tab The third and last section of the book was the authors' future predictions and conclusions. \par
\par
6)\tab In my opinion, every single argument and statement made by the authors are supported and demonstrated. Everytime a point is made about how an attacker may be getting into a system, an example is always provided through the use of a tool, a technique, or real world example.\par
\par
7) a) For the most part I enjoyed reading the book. Towards the end it started to get very hard for me to keep reading through to the end due to it's length, and depth about various topics. I was having a hard time absorbing all the information that was being provided to me, and I had spent a lot of time googling various things (such as "honeypots" or what a "zombie" attack was) just so that I could keep on reading the book, and have some idea of what was going on. I feel that if I had spent a few years in the industry before reading this book, I would have much more enjoyed reading it. But overall, it was an ok read, mostly because I had no idea what a lot of the topics being discussed were even about. I would give it a 2.5/5, only because I was not experienced enough with the issues and topics being discussed, but as for providing me with information, the book would have to get a 5/5.\par
\par
b) The book was not very easy to understand. Many times after reading a couple pages, I would have to stop and research various things before I could continue on reading, because I literally had never seen, or heard of some things. If a reader was familiar about the topics before\par
starting to read the book, I could see the book being an easy read for somebody like that. But as for me, the book was pretty hard to understand.\par
\par
c) I found for the most part the book to be interesting, although at times I found myself to be falling asleep trying to read it. It talked about many tools, topics, issues, and techniques that I found myself googling, and researching more after I read about them in the book because they sounded cool and interesting in the book. I find Computer Security to be very interesting, personally, so reading about a lot of the topics associated with it was very engaging, and somedays I would spent more than just a few hours reading the book, but hours reading things on the internet, and even downloading a program called Cain and Abel and trying to figure out how it was used.\par
\par
d) The book was not as outdated as i thought it would be (as far as I know), even though it was published in 2005. I read the second edition, and to my knowledge it was made to add up-to-date topics ontop of the first edition (I don't know this for sure, it was difficult to find any information about the first edition). A lot of the topics and tools that are discussed and demonstrated in the book are still in use today. To make the book completely up to date I would say that there are probably a lot of different techniques the attackers are using now then back in 2005, so if they ever were to make a third edition of this book, I would say that the only new information they would really need to add was attackers' techniques, and maybe a few new tools that they use today, that weren't available in 2005.\par
\par
e) I don't think that I would recommend the book to a classmate, only because many of the topics go way beyond what we are learning about in class. This book is meant for a more intermediate reader rather then a beginner (which I am assuming all of the people in the class are since we are first year students). \par
\par
f) I would absolutely not recommend this to anyone who is not in the computer industry because you need to know about many different topics such as networks, windows, scripting (in both Linux and Windows), tools, etc, and a basic fundemental knowledge of computers. It would be very difficult for somebody to read who has no experience with any of these very basic topics.\par
\par
g) The authors did not have any real baises, although they did show their opinions on some of the programs and tools they described, such as Hacker Defender and FU being two they didn't particularly like as well some they thought were exceptional.\par
\par
h) I felt that this book was very relevant to my career development. Being a Software Engineer, I need to have a fundemental knowledge about Computer Security so that I can prevent exploitations in the programs that I write. In the future I could be designing important systems, such as banking systems, and I need to know what I can do to prevent attacks from happening to my system.\par
\par
8) \tab My overall opinion of the book is that it is incredibly useful to somebody who has experience with much of the information talked about within it. Even though I am not very experienced with the topics they were discussing, I found most of the information very interesting, and thought provoking. It would be very hard for somebody to get through that has no experience with computers or Computer Security, because it goes so deep into the material and information that the authors provide. For example, even I had no clue what a zombie attack was, so I had to go and google exactly what it was, and I found out that it is an attack that is used to take over a victim machine, and then use that computer to attack another machine or system, making it very hard to detect where the actual threat is coming from. After reading about what it was, I was able to understand how it was done, and why someone might want to do that, but for somebody who does not know anything about networks, and monitoring a network will have no idea why an attacker will want to do this. \par
\tab As for the information provided, I feel the book does an exceptional job at providing it. They go in depth into many different tools like Cain and Abel, Nushu, etc, and many hacking techniques like zombie attacks, embedding data. They also provide ways to prevent attacks, for example they talk about how a honeypot can be created to detect attacks. The information they provide is solid, and very insightful.\par
\tab Although the book was long, and at times it was difficult for me to keep reading and being motivated to pick it up, I am glad I did because the information inside was very valuable, and I feel it was a very good eye opener to the rest of my schoo career and even after I graduate. Overall I would say I am not dissapointed I had to read the book, but not overly joyed as the book was long and draining, but I am glad I read it and in my opinion it is a very good book for information about Computer Security.\par
