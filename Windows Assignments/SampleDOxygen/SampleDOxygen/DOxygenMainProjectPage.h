/// \section intro System Introduction
/// It's always nice to use your <b><i>DOxygenMainPage.h</i></b> contents to tell the reader about your system.  Tell them about its purpose, its
/// features, what it can do, etc.  This kind of information would be contained in a <i>System Introduction</i> type of section like this one ...
/// 
/// You can also use this <i>mainpage</i> contents to tell the reader about :
/// - known issues and bugs
/// - new ideas and features that you think you might want to include
/// - some supplementary information and links that they might want to investigate
/// - your <i>Release Notes</i> (where you tell the user of your system about features added, bugs fixed in this release)
/// - you can give them information about any special system configuration files
/// - you can remind them of the system requirements
/// - etc.
///
/// The purpose of this <b><i>Some Sample Project</i></b> is to give you a baseline in terms of DOxygen-style commenting ...
/// Major DOxygen features to note are:
/// 
/// - the Project / Application description and documentation found in the <b>Main Page</b> 
/// - how <b>classes</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// - how <b>methods</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// - the fact that you can still comment your source code (in C or C++ style) and have DOxygen ignore those comments while constructing your Project documentation
///
///
/// That list of major DOxygen features (this time in a numbered list) are:
/// -# the Project / Application description and documentation found in the <b>Main Page</b> 
/// -# how <b>classes</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// -# how <b>methods</b> are commented using DOxygen
/// -# the fact that you can still comment your source code (in C or C++ style) and have DOxygen ignore those comments while constructing your Project documentation
///
///
/// If your project and/or documentation requires a link to some external link - you can easily include those in your DOxygen 
/// comments like this :
/// - <A target=blank HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/"> The main <i>DOxygen</i> web-site</A>
/// - <A target=blank HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html"> DOxygen formatting and content management</A>

/// \section notes Special Release Notes
/// If you are tracking the versioning of your project software (as you would in the real world) then this is a good place to
/// indicate (on a per version basis):
/// - features added to the software
/// - incidents / bugs / issues fixed
/// - etc.
///
/// <hr>
/// \section sampleTextFile Configuration File
/// I can include the contents of TEXT files <i>as is</i> directly into the DOxygen comments.  If you are going to want to include file contents,
/// you need to make sure that you setup the EXAMPLE_PATH DOxygen project parameter in the <i>Expert</i> tab / <i>Input</i> settings ...
/// \verbinclude SampleProject.cfg
///
/// <hr>
/// \section requirements Project Requirements
/// I can include the contents of an HTML version of the <i>Requirements Document</i> directly into the DOxygen comments - in BLOCKQUOTE style.  
/// Again, if you are going to want to include file contents, you need to make sure that you setup the EXAMPLE_PATH DOxygen project parameter 
/// in the <i>Expert</i> tab / <i>Input</i> settings ...
/// <blockquote>
/// \htmlinclude SomeProjectRequirements.htm
/// </blockquote>
///
/// If you also want to include some (or all) of the Project's requirements in your DOxygen documentation - you could use this space to do so.
///
/// <i>Please Note : The requirement(s) summary doesn't have to be an SRS by any means ...</i>
/// <hr> 
/// \section futureIdeas Future Release Features and Ideas
/// If you want to, you can include a section in your <i>mainpage</i> to tell the reader about ideas that you have for future releases. 
///

/// \todo Give each todo item its own line
