\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plan was to move all of the functions that have to do with the U\-I menu out of \hyperlink{project_8cpp}{project.\-cpp}, and into the classes, but I ran out of time to do it. This would have made the classes much less trivial. Also not having these functions in the classes made it not possible to unit test them (without just copying them into the unit test file), except for the ones that I have unit tested already in the classes (which is why 1 unit test module is missing, no functions to test!).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000001}{Todo}]Move functions into classes 

Create test module \#3\end{DoxyRefDesc}
