\subsection{Detailed Description}
{\bfseries This class models an A\-M/\-F\-M radio} 

This comment block is {\itshape required} for all class declarations. This is the place where the {\bfseries class header comment} appears. Remember that the {\bfseries class header comment} is used to tell the reader (of your code and comments) exactly what you are trying to model in the class. What does it represent in reality ? How could some programmer use this class ? What benefits does it have ?

Within the class definition, you should also comment \-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item class constants and class data members (attributes) and their purpose
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item N\-O\-T\-E\-: If you set up your D\-Oxygen project properly, you can have D\-Oxygen extract this constant and data memeber information from your code for {\bfseries {\itshape private}}, {\bfseries {\itshape protected}} and {\bfseries {\itshape public}} levels of visibility
\item In the D\-Oxygen {\itshape Expert} tab, ensure that you have the E\-X\-T\-R\-A\-C\-T\-\_\-\-P\-R\-I\-V\-A\-T\-E, E\-X\-T\-R\-A\-C\-T\-\_\-\-S\-T\-A\-T\-I\-C, E\-X\-T\-R\-A\-C\-T\-\_\-\-L\-O\-C\-A\-L\-\_\-\-C\-L\-A\-S\-S\-E\-S and E\-X\-T\-R\-A\-C\-T\-\_\-\-L\-O\-C\-A\-L\-\_\-\-M\-E\-T\-H\-O\-D\-S checked
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item any and all {\bfseries methods} in the proper {\itshape Method Header Commenting} style (see Another\-Class() below)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item again this applies to methods for all levels of visibility ...
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

When it comes to commenting the body of your code, or commenting anything within any of your source modules that you want D\-Oxygen to ignore -\/ simply use standard C++ comments
